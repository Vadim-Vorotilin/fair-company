## Antifragility ##

"Some things benefit from shocks; they thrive and grow when exposed to volatility, randomness, disorder, and stressors and love adventure, risk, and uncertainty. Yet, in spite of the ubiquity of the phenomenon, there is no word for the exact opposite of fragile. Let us call it antifragile. Antifragility is beyond resilience or robustness. The resilient resists shocks and stays the same; the antifragile gets better" - Nassim Nicholas Taleb.

1. _Decentralisation_. A centralised system is inflexible and thus has higher chances to fail in a constantly changing environment.
2. _Each member may make a decision_. Based on the axiom “nobody’s perfect”, a system as a whole has higher chances of survival if each of its elements has freedom of action.
3. _All experience should be aggregated and documented_. There’s no bad experience. Any experience has its findings and results. The system should use and not ignore those to its benefit.
