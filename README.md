1. The only reason to maintain the company is to pursue common interests of both the members and the clients.
    Consequently this means:
    - Family is more important than work.
    - Work shouldn’t be a burden.
    - Personal interests and hobbies are as much important as work.
    - The members have a right for a happy life filled with positive emotions.
    - The clients should be happy with our work and hence have more positive emotions in their lives.

2. Each member may decide on their own how, when, with whom, and where to carry out their professional activities (see Antifragility p.2).
    This means that each member has to have a set of mental, social and professional abilities:
    - Empathy
    - Friendliness
    - Responsibility
    - Time management
    - Planning and realistic estimation

3. There’s no difference between work and personal time in terms of privacy, each member may use their time as they need. No other member may intrude into plans of others.
4. Every culture is different and unique. There’s no primary culture and all members should be treated with respect to differences we may have.
5. English language is used as a means of communication, that doesn’t mean that native English speakers’ culture should prevail.
6. There are no senior nor junior members. Everyone of us has a different set of skills, experience, and background leading to different ways of acting. There’s no better or worse way.

"Some things benefit from shocks; they thrive and grow when exposed to volatility, randomness, disorder, and stressors and love adventure, risk, and uncertainty. Yet, in spite of the ubiquity of the phenomenon, there is no word for the exact opposite of fragile. Let us call it antifragile. Antifragility is beyond resilience or robustness. The resilient resists shocks and stays the same; the antifragile gets better" - Nassim Nicholas Taleb.

1. _Decentralisation_. A centralised system is inflexible and thus has higher chances to fail in a constantly changing environment.
2. _Each member may make a decision_. Based on the axiom “nobody’s perfect”, a system as a whole has higher chances of survival if each of its elements has freedom of action.
3. _All experience should be aggregated and documented_. There’s no bad experience. Any experience has its findings and results. The system should use and not ignore those to its benefit.
