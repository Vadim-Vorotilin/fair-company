# Manifesto # 

## Postulates ##

1. The only reason to maintain the company is to pursue common interests of both the members and the clients.
    Consequently this means:
    - Family is more important than work.
    - Work shouldn’t be a burden.
    - Personal interests and hobbies are as much important as work.
    - The members have a right for a happy life filled with positive emotions.
    - The clients should be happy with our work and hence have more positive emotions in their lives.

2. Each member may decide on their own how, when, with whom, and where to carry out their professional activities (see [Antifragility](philosophy.md#antifragility) p.2).
    This means that each member has to have a set of mental, social and professional abilities:
    - Empathy
    - Friendliness
    - Responsibility
    - Time management
    - Planning and realistic estimation

3. There’s no difference between work and personal time in terms of privacy, each member may use their time as they need. No other member may intrude into plans of others.
4. Every culture is different and unique. There’s no primary culture and all members should be treated with respect to differences we may have.
5. English language is used as a means of communication, that doesn’t mean that native English speakers’ culture should prevail.
6. There are no senior nor junior members. Everyone of us has a different set of skills, experience, and background leading to different ways of acting. There’s no better or worse way.

## Notes ##

- Even though these ideas might seem anarchistic, they should be used in balance by first thinking and discussing and then applying.
- The target size of a Fair Company is from 1 to 20 people.
